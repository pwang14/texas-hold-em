# Texas Hold'em

This program simulates a 1v1 game of Texas Hold'em against a bot.
Every round, the bot uses a probabilistic analysis of all possible hands given its current hand to determine the strength of its hand.
The bot then performs an action according to its hand strength as well as the action of the user.

Run dealer.cpp to start the program.
